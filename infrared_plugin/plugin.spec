              A list of files and directories to gather from the target.
              Directories are collected recursively and need to end with a “/”
              to get collected. Should be specified as a YaML list, e.g.:
                infrared ansible-role-collect-logs \
                  --artcl_collect_list /etc/nova/,/home/stack/*.log,/var/log/
